As part of a master plan to move to Oahu where a new lifestyle of daily surfing can be funded by a successful Surf n’ Shake shop, this project requires an understanding of data storage and retrieval to convince potential investor W.Avy that weather won’t disrupt possible profits. The goal of this analysis was to illustrate how known weather patterns might affect the proposed site.
